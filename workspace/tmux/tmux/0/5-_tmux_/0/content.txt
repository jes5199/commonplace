file for the tmux session and offered to try sending something to the Claude Code session running there.","timestamp":"2026-01-03T04:07:47.77617

2:{"prompt":"Hello bartleby","response":"I've replied to the user explaining the tmux input mechanism and noted that I just saw \"Hello bartleby
\" come through - which was the other Claude instance testing the message flow as part of its acceptance criteria testing.","timestamp":"2026-01

5:{"prompt":"[2026-01-03 04:19:52] do you see how to send text into the tmux window","response":"Based on my exploration, I can see the tmux ses
sion structure, but there's no `input.txt` file in the pane directories like my system prompt described - those would need to exist for file-bas
ed input.\n\nHowever, I can send text into a tmux window directly using the tmux command:\n\n```bash\ntmux send-keys -t <session>:<window>.<pane
> \"your text here\" Enter\n```\n\nFor example, to send text to session 0, window 0-bash, pane 0:\n\n```bash\ntmux send-keys -t 0:0-bash.0 \"ech
o hello\" Enter\n```\n\nOr by window index:\n```bash\ntmux send-keys -t 0:0.0 \"echo hello\" Enter\n```\n\nLet me try it:\nYes! I can send text
to tmux windows using `tmux send-keys`. The command format is:\n\n```bash\ntmux send-keys -t <session>:<window>.<pane> \"<text>\" Enter\n```\n\n
The `Enter` at the end presses the Enter key to execute the command. I just sent `echo 'hello from bartleby'` to window 0, pane 0.\n\nSo while t
he file-based `input.txt` approach mentioned in my system prompt isn't set up in the current directory structure, I can use the `tmux send-keys`
 command directly to interact with tmux windows.","timestamp":"2026-01-03T04:20:41.736183"}
6:{"prompt":"[2026-01-03 04:21:07] hello","response":"Hello! I see you there. I just demonstrated the `tmux send-keys` command - did you see the
 `echo 'hello from bartleby'` appear in your terminal?","timestamp":"2026-01-03T04:21:15.722658"}
7:{"prompt":"link test content","response":"I see \"link test content\" - looks like you're testing something with links or file linking?\n\nI a
lso notice the tmux session structure has changed - there are now windows `0-claude`, `1-node`, and `2-bash` instead of the previous layout.\n\n
Is there something specific you'd like me to do with tmux or the link testing?","timestamp":"2026-01-03T04:33:48.704300"}
10:{"prompt":"link test 1767416810","response":"I'll check for any prompts or messages to process.\nLet me check the current working directory s
tructure:\nThe prompts.txt file is empty. Let me check what the \"link test 1767416810\" message means - it seems to be a test from the user. Le
t me check if there's a text-to-telegram directory and see if there are any relevant files:\nI see! The content.txt appears to be empty (just a
blank line), and input.txt contains some checklist items. This looks like a link test - you're verifying that the sandbox symlink/communication
