{"id":"CP-oji","title":"Handle rename events so new paths get sync tasks","description":"notify reports renames as `Modify(Name)` events; the current mapping treats all `is_modify()` as `DirEvent::Modified`. The modified handler only re-pushes schema and never starts new per-file sync tasks or removes old ones, so a rename leaves the new file untracked and the old path's tasks running until restart.\n\nConsider handling rename explicitly (or treating `Modify(Name)` as delete+create).","design":"In the directory event handling (around line 1052 in sync.rs), detect `Modify(Name)` events separately from other modifications. When a rename is detected:\n1. Stop sync tasks for the old path\n2. Start new sync tasks for the new path\n3. Update file_states accordingly\n\nAlternative: Treat rename as delete of old path + create of new path, reusing existing handlers.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-26T17:03:59.632881-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-26T17:03:59.632881-08:00","labels":["enhancement","sync"]}
